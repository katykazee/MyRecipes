Pour the sauce into the inner liner of your Instant Pot.

Place the chicken on top and push it down into the sauce just a little.

Set it at High Pressure for 10 minutes and let it release pressure naturally.

**OR COOK 4-6 HOURS ON LOW IN SLOW COOKER (AY)**

Carefully take out the chicken and cut into bite size pieces.

Add coconut milk and garam masala, put the chicken back in, and eat.
Garnish with cilantro if you'd like.
