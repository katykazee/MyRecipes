**Instructions**

Blend together the vegetables and spices listed in the "blend together" section. Basically blend everything except chicken, coconut milk, cilantro, and set aside one teaspoons of garam masala for the end.
Pour the sauce into the inner liner of your Instant Pot.

Place the chicken on top and push it down into the sauce just a little.

Set it at High Pressure for 10 minutes and let it release pressure naturally.

Carefully take out the chicken and cut into bite size pieces.

Add coconut milk and garam masala, put the chicken back in, and eat.
Garnish with cilantro if you'd like.
